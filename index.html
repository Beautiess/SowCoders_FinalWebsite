  <h2>What is Unemployment?</h2>
  <div class="what">
    <p>Unemployment is a term referring to individuals</P>
    <p>who are employable and actively seeking a job but are unable to find a job.</p>
    <p>Included in this group are those people in the workforce</p>
    <p>who are working but do not have an appropriate job.</p>
    <p>Usually measured by the unemployment rate,</p>
    <p>which is dividing the number of unemployed people</p>
    <p>by the total number of people in the workforce,</p>
    <p>unemployment serves as one of the indicators of a country’s economic status.</p>

  <h2>Understanding Unemployment</h2>
  <div class="under">
    <p>The term “unemployment” is often misunderstood, it as it includes people</p>
    <p>who are waiting to return to a job after being discharged,</p>
    <p>yet it does not include individuals who have stopped looking for work in the past</p>
    <p>due to various reasons such as leaving work to pursue</p>
    <p>higher education, retirement, disability, and personal issues.</p>
    <p>Also people who are not actively seeking a job</p>
    <p>but do want to work are not classified as unemployed.</p>
