  <h1>The Unemployment</h1>
  <h2>Cause</h2>
  <div class="cause">
    <p>Unemployment is caused by various reasons that come from both the demand side,</p>
    <p>or employer, and the supply side, or the worker. Demand-side reductions may be caused</p>
    <p>by high interest rates, global recession, and financial crisis. From the supply side,</p>
    <p>frictional unemployment and structural employment play a great role.</p>

  <h2>Effects</h2>
  <div class="effect">
    <p>The impact of unemployment can be felt by both the workers</p>
    <p>and the national economy and can cause a ripple effect.</p>
    <p>Unemployment causes workers to suffer financial hardship that</p>
    <p>impacts families, relationships, and communities. When it happens,</p>
    <p>consumer spending, which is one of an economy’s key drivers of growth,</p>
    <p>goes down, leading to a recession or even a depression when left unaddressed.</p>

  <h2>Long-term vs. Short-term</h2>
  <div class="vs">
    <p>Unemployment that lasts longer than 27 weeks even if the individual has</p>
    <p>sought employment in the last four weeks is called long-term unemployment.</p>
    <p>Its effects are far worse than short-term unemployment for obvious reasons,</p>
    <p>and the following are noted as some of its effects.</p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Some 56% of the long-term unemployed reported a significant decrease<br>
      in their net worth.</li><br>
    <li>Financial problems are not the only effects of long-term unemployment <br>
      as 46% of those in such a state reported experiencing strained family<br>
      relationships. The figure is relatively higher than the 39% percent who<br>
      weren’t unemployed for as long.</li><br>
    <li>Another 43% of the long-term unemployed reported a significant effect<br>
      on their ability to achieve their career goals.</li><br>
    <li>Sadly, long-term unemployment led to 38% of these individuals losing<br>
      their self-respect and 24% seeking professional help.</li><br>
  </ul>
